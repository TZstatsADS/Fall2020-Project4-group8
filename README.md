+ Project summary: This project explores different causal inference algorithms in details through manual implementations in Python and estimation of propensty scores. The algorithms include full matching using three distance metrics Mahalanobis, propensity score and linear propensity score, Inverse Propensity Weighting and Stratification. Details of implementation and explanation of each alogorithm used can be found in the doc folder of the repository, as well as a project report.

Rohan Uppuluri worked on implementing full matching using the Mahalanobis, propensity score, and linear propensity score metrics with Elise. Rohan also wrote the explanation of the concept of full matching and the Mahalanobis metric documentation in the main notebook and in the presentation.

Linh Nguyen: found documentation on Full matching function in R and how to use R in Python for Rohan to implement. Implemented full matching using the Mahalanobis, propensity score, and linear propensity score metrics on high dimensional dataset; Compiled Main notebook, added to documentation on full matching, propensity score and linear propensity score in the Main notebook & powerpoint presentation. Put together outline for written report and ppt presentation & installation instructions.  

Natalie Williams implemented the stratify algorithm and ATE calculation from stratification algorithm.
